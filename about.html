	<!-- Featured Post -->
	              <p> I am very thankful for providing me this opportunity and it is with a sincere sense of gratification that I pen my brief statement. The Master’s Degree which I pursued at the West Chester University of Pennsylvania in Computer Science further advanced the deep curiosity I had in computers and mathematics since childhood. It is only natural that after completing my Degree. The deep interest in computer science was engendered, when I was introduced to languages like BASIC and LOGO, at an early age at school. I studied at the University of Baghdad and I got My Bachelor’s degree in Computer Engineering, after 7 years of the experience I decided to combine between Hardware and Software by getting my M.S degree in Computer Science that has the goal of imparting quality education and inculcating scientific and research-oriented thinking as one of its prime objectives, also equally accentuating the importance of human ethics and its role in education. This shaped me into a student with a sense of responsibility and character. After I entered High School, I was exposed to languages such as C, C++, Java, and many more. This really opened new avenues for me, and I became totally engrossed in learning and applying them. My interest in mathematics prompted me to take up Algorithm design and, studying this was a joy. I have always felt comfortable with the subjects of mathematics & physics and my stable performance in these areas evince the reason. 
					Also, after I successfully completed my M.S degree, I plan to do my increase my experience in this field and also do my Ph.D. in the near future. </p><br><br><br><br><br>
